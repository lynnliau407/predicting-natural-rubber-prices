Predicting Natural Rubber Prices                         
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) 
• Conducted time series analysis on predicting natural rubber prices using statistical and machine learning methods, including ARIMA-GARCH, exponential smoothing, and LSTM, analysing data from 24 years to compare forecasting models. 
• Enhanced prediction accuracy and reliability by performing hyperparameter optimisation and model evaluation, resulting in a 15% improvement in model performance. 
• Evaluated model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, leading to more reliable price predictions.
